## Theme Config File <small>"themeConfig.json"</small>

This "modern-theme" generator is basically built to speed up the process of using
popular grunt plugins (that you maybe are using in every theme),
without the need to touch your `Gruntfile.js` file.

The generator is using a special config file `themeConfig.json` to do so.
