## Modern Drupal Theme

This project is intended to speed up the process for creating Drupal themes using Grunt and Bower.

The project is still under active development and would be very hard to be used without documentation. So, please stay tuned for documentation.

Features to come:
- Javascript concatenation and minification.
- CSS concatenation and minification.
- Compiling SASS files.
